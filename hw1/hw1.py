# Goal: Given an input image with five randomly positioned pure colors, ascertain
# the positions of these colors and return their values in various formats

# For each function, return a list of color representations of the corresponding
# point (1 for getColorOne, 2 for getColorTwo...) in the following format:
# [[R, G, B], [B, G, R], [H, S, V], grayscale]
