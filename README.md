## Installing OpenCV
You have several options:
### 1.) Installation via Anaconda (my recommendation)
Go to the [installation guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) for Anaconda (Miniconda might be preferred) and run `conda install python`.

### 2.) Installation via 3rd party library
Simply run `pip install opencv-python`. While this is the simplest option there are no guarantees of success as this is sort of an unofficial packaging of the library.

### 3.) Build from source
Please don't do this.
