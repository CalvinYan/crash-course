## Installing OpenCV
You have several options:
### 1.) Installation via Anaconda )
Go to the [installation guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) for Anaconda (Miniconda might be preferred) and run `conda install opencv`.  

### 2.) Installation via 3rd party library (my recommendation)
Simply run `pip install opencv-python`. This is a third-party pre-build installation, but is widely known to be reliable.

### 3.) Build from source
Please don't do this.
